# Research parasite

[Research parasites](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMe1516564) are:

> people who had nothing to do with the design and execution of the study but
> use another groupâ€™s data for their own ends, possibly stealing from the
> research productivity planned by the data gatherers, or even use the data to
> try to disprove what the original investigators had posited.

In the interests of science, we should never ever reuse data or heaven forbid,
try to disprove each other. This repository contains notes on how research
parasites may download your data. To protect yourself as a "front-line
researcher" you should never deposit your data to any of the following
resources (or publish your research, for that matter) or risk being proven
wrong by someone who re-analysed your data with more appropriate and/or updated
methodology.
